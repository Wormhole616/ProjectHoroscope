## Description

Welcome to StellarScopes! This app uses a user input birthday to make API calls to multiple server-side API's to provide the user with information about both their Western and Chinese zodiac sign amongst other sign traits. Listen to what the universe has to say about your future!

## Installation

## Usage

The user enters their birthday in the field(s) provided and click the Submit button. From there, the user is able to toggle and view different results about their sun symbol, element, and their horoscope as well as their Chinese zodiac sign. If the user opens the Dev Tools in Google Chrome, they can see the information resulting from the API calls being made, from which the Results are pulled and displayed seamlessly.

## Features
